## Repartition And Coalesce:
In Apache Spark, repartition and coalesce are both used to control the number of partitions in an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) or DataFrame, but they differ in how they achieve it and their use cases. Repartition can increase or decrease the number of partitions, always involving a full shuffle of the data, while coalesce is primarily for decreasing partitions and avoids a full shuffle by merging existing partitions, making it faster for reducing partitions. 

# Key Differences:
**Shuffle:**
repartition always performs a full shuffle of the data, redistributing it across the new partitions, while coalesce tries to minimize shuffling by merging existing partitions. 
**Partition Count:**
repartition can increase or decrease the number of partitions, while coalesce is primarily used to reduce the number of partitions. 
**Efficiency:**
repartition can be computationally expensive due to the shuffle, while coalesce is generally faster and more efficient when reducing partitions, especially after filtering. 
## When to Use:
**repartition:**
When you need to control the number of partitions and potentially redistribute data across partitions, including increasing or decreasing them. 
When you need to guarantee an even distribution of data across partitions, as it involves a full shuffle. 
**coalesce:**
When you want to reduce the number of partitions efficiently, minimizing data movement. 
When you are reducing partitions after heavy filtering, as it avoids a full shuffle. 
When you want to write data to HDFS or other sinks, as reducing partitions can improve write performance.
